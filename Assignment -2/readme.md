# FastAPI Chat API with OpenAI Integration

This is a simple FastAPI application that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to provide a chat-based interface. The API accepts a user's query, sends it to OpenAI, and returns the generated response.

## Features
- A basic endpoint to handle user input and return a response from OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- Error handling to manage any issues during the API call to OpenAI.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

6. Run the FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Endpoints

### `GET /`
A simple health check endpoint that returns a welcome message.
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {"message": "Welcome to the chat API!"}
  ```

### `POST /chat`
This endpoint allows users to send a query and receive a response from GPT-4.
- **Request body**:
  ```json
  {
    "query": "Your question or query here"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "response": "The generated response from GPT-4"
  }
  ```

### Example

#### Request:
```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "What is the capital of France?"
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "response": "The capital of France is Paris."
}
```

## Error Handling
If there is an error while processing the request or calling OpenAI, the server will respond with a 500 status code and a message detailing the error.

### Example Error Response:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message from the exception"
}
```

## Running the Application
After setting up and installing dependencies, you can run the FastAPI server using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Once the server is running, you can test the API by sending HTTP requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
